# 49. Group Anagrams
## Question Level: Medium
### Description:
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

### Examples:
#### Example 1:

Input: strs = `["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`<br>
Output: `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`<br>
Explanation:
- There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`.
- The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
= The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
#### Example 2:
Input: strs = `[""]`<br>
Output: `[[""]]`<br>

#### Example 3:

Input: strs = `["a"]`<br>
Output: `[["a"]]`<br>

### Constraints:

- 1 <= `strs.length` <= 10^4
- 0 <= `strs[i].length` <= 100
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
