# 232. Implement Queue using Stacks
## Question Level: Easy
### Description:
Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the MyQueue class:
- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
- `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
- `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `boolean empty()` Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:  
- You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.

### Examples:
#### Example 1:

Input:
```Java
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
```
Output:
```Java
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]
```

Explanation:
```Java
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= `x` <= 9
- At most 100 calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
- All the calls to pop and peek are valid.

### <i>Follow-up: 
Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized `O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.

### Concepts Used:
- Stack
- Design
- Queue</i>
