# 8. String to Integer (atoi)
## Question Level: Medium
### Description:
Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

- Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
- Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity is neither present.
- Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
- Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be rounded to -2^31, and integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be rounded to 2^31 - 1.
<br>Return the integer as the final result.

### Example:
<b>Example 1:</b>
Input: s = "42"
Output: 42
Explanation:
The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
- Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
- Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
- Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)

<b>Example 2:</b><br>
Input: s = " -042"<br>
Output: -42<br>
Explanation:<br>
- Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
- Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
- Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)

<b>Example 3:</b><br>
Input: s = "1337c0d3"<br>
Output: 1337<br>
Explanation:
- Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
- Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
- Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)

<b>Example 4:</b><br>
Input: s = "0-1"<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation:
- Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
- Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
- Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)

<b>Example 5:</b><br>
Input: s = "words and 987"<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation:
- Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.

### Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 200
- s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ``' '``, ``'+'``, ``'-'``, and ``'.'``.
