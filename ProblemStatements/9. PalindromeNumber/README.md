# 9. Palindrome Number
## Question Level: Easy
### Description:
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

### Examples:
<b>Example 1:</b><br>
Input: x = 121<br>
Output: true<br>
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.<br>

<b>Example 2:</b><br>
Input: x = -121<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<br>

<b>Example 3:</b><br>
Input: x = 10<br>
Output: false<br>
