# 187. Repeated DNA Sequences
## Question Level: Medium
### Description:
The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as '`A`', '`C`', '`G`', and '`T`'.

For example, "`ACGAATTCCG`" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

### Examples:
#### Example 1:

Input: s = "`AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT`"  
Output: `["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]`
#### Example 2:

Input: s = "`AAAAAAAAAAAAA`"  
Output: `["AAAAAAAAAA"]`

### Constraints:

- 1 <= `s.length` <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- `s[i]` is either '`A`', '`C`', '`G`', or '`T`'.
