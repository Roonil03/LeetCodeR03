# 796. Rotate String
## Question Level: Easy
### Description:
Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "``abcde``", then it will be "``bcdea``" after one shift.

### Examples:
#### Example 1:
Input: s = "``abcde``", goal = "``cdeab``"<br>
Output: true

#### Example 2:
Input: s = "``abcde``", goal = "``abced``"<br>
Output: false

### Constraints:

- 1 <= ``s.length``, ``goal.length`` <= 100
- ``s`` and ``goal`` consist of lowercase English letters.
