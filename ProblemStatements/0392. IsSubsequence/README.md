# 392. Is Subsequence
## Question Level: Easy
### Description:
Given two strings s and t, return `true` if s is a subsequence of t, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "`ace`" is a subsequence of "`abcde`" while "`aec`" is not).

### Examples:
#### Example 1:

Input: s = "`abc`", t = "`ahbgdc`"<br>
Output: true<br>
#### Example 2:

Input: s = "`axc`", t = "`ahbgdc`"<br>
Output: false<br>

### Constraints:

- 0 <= `s.length` <= 100
- 0 <= `t.length` <= 10^4
- s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
