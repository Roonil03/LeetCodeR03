# 3333. Find the Original Typed String II
## Question Level: Hard
### Description:
Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen. You are also given a positive integer k.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of size at least k.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.

### Examples:
#### Example 1:

Input: word = "`aabbccdd`", k = 7

Output: 5

Explanation:

The possible strings are: "`aabbccdd`", "`aabbccd`", "`aabbcdd`", "`aabccdd`", and "`abbccdd`".

#### Example 2:

Input: word = "`aabbccdd`", k = 8

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only possible string is "`aabbccdd`".

#### Example 3:

Input: word = "`aaabbb`", k = 3

Output: 8

### Constraints:

- 1 <= `word.length` <= 5 * 10<sup>5</sup>
- `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- 1 <= `k` <= 2000
